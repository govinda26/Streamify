# 🎵 Streamify – Backend Learning Project

Streamify is a **backend-focused learning project** built as part of understanding how real-world backend systems work using **JavaScript and Node.js**.

This project follows a structured backend approach inspired by modern backend architectures and best practices. The goal of Streamify is to strengthen backend fundamentals by building features similar to a **media / streaming platform**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Streamify is designed as a **practice backend project** that focuses on:

- API design
- Authentication & authorization
- Database modeling
- Secure backend practices
- Scalable project structure

The project simulates backend functionality for a streaming-style application and is intended purely for **learning and skill development**.

## 🧱 Tech Stack Used

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB**
- **Mongoose**
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
- **bcrypt**
- **JavaScript**

---

## 🔐 Core Backend Concepts Implemented

- User authentication (Signup / Login)
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT-based authentication
- Access tokens & refresh tokens
- RESTful API structure
- Controller–Service based architecture
- MongoDB schema modeling with Mongoose
- Environment-based configuration

---

## ✨ Features (Backend)

- User registration and login
- Secure password storage
- Token-based authentication
- Protected routes
- Structured controllers and routes
- Scalable backend folder structure

*(This project focuses on backend logic and APIs rather than UI.)*
